## Bootstrap Frankie Rose Fan Site

For this deliverable I chose the Bootstrap framework and included several elements.

## Bootstrap Elements Incorporated

1. Jumbotron - Used as the header. I also incorporated some animation to provide some impact when the page is loaded. 
2. Carousel - With some additional CSS settings I was able to get images of various sizes to display properly. 
3. Card Group - Convenient way to display Frankie's discography, using the card with image at the top and button at the bottom linking to the album on Bandcamp.
4. List Group - Used to link several articles about Frankie Rose.
5. Form - Used to create a fictional signup for information about the artist. 

### Lessons Learned
1. The Bootstrap documentation is exceptional - if your intent is to work exclusively in their sandbox. In order to manipulate the layout googling the change with 'bootstrap' appended to the search was fruitful.
2. For a quick and dirty site that still looks professional it's hard to beat Bootstrap.
3. Once the you understand the Bootstrap naming and class conventions it's quite easy to use.
